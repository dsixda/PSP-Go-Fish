Rules:
------

1) Both players (you and computer) start with 7 cards in a hand. 
2) If a hand has any pairs, they are taken out and kept in the player's stash.
3) Players take turns asking the other player if they have a particular card of the same value that they currently have in their own hand.
 
  e.g. 
  Player 1 asks: "Do you have a Jack?")
  Player 2 will give that card to Player 1 if he has a Jack of any suit
  Player 1 takes his new pair of Jacks and puts them into his stash.    
  Player 1 goes again.

  Player 1 asks: "Do you have a 2?"
  Player 2 doesn't have a 2 in his hand, so he goes "Go Fish"
  Player 1 takes one card from the deck (all cards in deck are face down)
  Player 1 puts down any possible pairs resulting from this new card
  Player 2 gets his turn now. And so on.

  NOTE: The first turn in the game is randomly selected.

4) The game ends when either a player finishes his hand or the deck runs out of cards.  The winner is the player with the most pairs.
